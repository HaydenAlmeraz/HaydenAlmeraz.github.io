<p> Entry 1 - I have learned how to create a div and how to make an image the background for my website. I am feeling good about my website but some of the things I am learning are confusing. I am working on making the front page of my website with a soccer net in the back and then different sections in the goal with categories like journal and the things i've made. I am excited to continue working on it. It is a little frustrating that it is very hard to work on the project without the help of a teacher since it is very new to me. In the next week or two I hope to finish the front page and start working on my subsections in my website. </p> 
<p> Entry 2 - This week I made an animation using Javascript. I made it to learn more about the new language and to also become better at using code. I put this project in my projects page on my website. I also updated my website on terminal. I feel good about my website and animation project. I learned how to put different pages into my website. I am a little frustrated by the amount of steps that I need to memorize when starting a new project and pushing my website.</p>
<p> Entry 3 - A variable is something that stores information to be used later in your code. A function is made up of variables and is used for holding a large amount of code. You make a function run by saying the name of the function and the variables that are part of it. Some words that I have learned in Javascript are, function, console log, and text/javascript. In my codesketch I use my function to figure out a multiplication problem.
<p> Entry 4 - I am working on making all of my pages have a soccer field backround to add to the theme of soccer in my website. I changed my Projects page but I am having a little trouble changing the other pages. I hope to have this completed by the end of the weekend. I also would like to create another project that uses a function.
<p> Entry 5 - I am working on a soccer game and I have added a soccer goal and a ball image. I now need to add a goalie. I also learned how to create an array, and I went over a checklist of all the different things my webstite needs. Lastly, I need to create a how it works presentation on an object that needs code to be created.
<p> Entry 6 - I learned how to use javascript to create a random emoji generator. I chose different fruits and by creating a variable called stuff and using math.random I was able to create the project. I also pushed my website.</p>
<p> Entry 7 - I created a Javascript image generator. I used a variable slice that I put into the body. Then I edited the size of the image and created another variable i. I set i to 0 and said that when i reached 1001 then it would stop which created 1000 cookies. Last I set the function i to the innertext so that each cookie would be numbered.
