<p> Entry 1 - I have learned how to create a div and how to make an image the background for my website. I am feeling good about my website but some of the things I am learning are confusing. I am working on making the front page of my website with a soccer net in the back and then different sections in the goal with categories like journal and the things i've made. I am excited to continue working on it. It is a little frustrating that it is very hard to work on the project without the help of a teacher since it is very new to me. In the next week or two I hope to finish the front page and start working on my subsections in my website. </p> 
<p> Entry 2 - This week I made an animation using Javascript. I made it to learn more about the new language and to also become better at using code. I put this project in my projects page on my website. I also updated my website on terminal. I feel good about my website and animation project. I learned how to put different pages into my website. I am a little frustrated by the amount of steps that I need to memorize when starting a new project and pushing my website.</p>
